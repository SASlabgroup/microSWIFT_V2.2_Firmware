Lengthy list of TODOs:

[ ] Change all non-threadx objects to static allocation -- remove from App_ThreadX_Init()
[ ] Make a control thread
    [ ] Move startup and end-of-cycle thread functions inside
    [ ] make event loop handler type deal to look for error flags or something
[ ] Figure out how to disable watchdog in debug mode
[ ] Fill out Tx low power functions and see if things work with Stop1 mode
    [ ] Non-critical, if it makes everything fall apart, ditch it
[ ] Change end of cycle sleep to shutdown mode, wakeup on int <a,b> from RTC
[ ] Figure out how to get threads running concurrently: i.e. CT sampling while GNSS wrapping up
    [ ] Should be easy with control thread
