Lengthy list of TODOs:

****************************************************************************************************
General
****

[ ] Figure out how to disable watchdog in debug mode
[ ] Change end of cycle sleep to shutdown mode, wakeup on int <a,b> from RTC
[ ] Make sure everything sticks to the principle that there are no infinite loops
[ ] Ditch watchdog hour timer and all that baggage
[ ] Modify linker script -- add external memory if necessary
    
****************************************************************************************************
GNSS
****

[ ] Give GNSS a FIFO for messages
[ ] Generalize UART to a better degree
[ ] Move the callback function for setting up DMA to inside gnss.c
[ ] See if initialization and configuration can be improved -- there has to be a better way to
    get the config done
[ ] Reorg functions and clean up comments

****************************************************************************************************
Iridium
****

[ ] Switch UART over to using a generic uart driver
[ ] Reorg functions and clean up comments

****************************************************************************************************
ThreadX
****

[ ] Change all non-threadx objects to static allocation -- remove from App_ThreadX_Init()
[ ] Make a control thread
    [ ] Move startup and end-of-cycle thread functions inside
    [ ] make event loop handler type deal to look for error flags or something
[ ] Fill out Tx low power functions and see if things work with Stop1 mode
    [ ] Non-critical, if it makes everything fall apart, ditch it
[ ] Figure out how to get threads running concurrently: i.e. CT sampling while GNSS wrapping up
    [ ] Should be easy with control thread
